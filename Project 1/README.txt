You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 1.
Failure to do so will result in deduction of points.

To compile on terminal type
  make clean
  make all

To delete executables and object file type
  make clean

To run:

./test_points2

^^In that case you will provide input from standard input.

To run with a given file that is redirected to standard input:

./test_points2 < test_input_file.txt

What I have completed:
I. All parts of the assignment were completed
The outputs match the expected outputs
II. A bug I had was that for the one parameter constructor I didn't define size so it was in an infinite loop.
III. No additional instructions are necessary
