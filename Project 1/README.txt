You will use this exact Makefile for your Homework 1.
Failure to do so will result in deduction of points.

To compile on terminal type
  make clean
  make all

To delete executables and object file type
  make clean

To run:

./test_points2

^^In that case you will provide input from standard input.

To run with a given file that is redirected to standard input:

./test_points2 < test_input_file.txt

What I have completed:
I've completed the implementing the Big 5 and the overloading operators
The outputs match the expected outputs
